Disaster Response Automation Platform
Overview
The Disaster Response Automation Platform is an open-source system designed to enhance disaster management efforts by automating the collection, processing, and dissemination of critical disaster-related information. Built on Kestra, this platform provides a scalable and declarative approach to workflow orchestration, ensuring seamless integration and processing of data from various APIs.

Features
Kestra Workflow Automation: Centralized orchestration for all disaster-related tasks, from data fetching to notification.
Weather Monitoring: Fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Earthquake Tracking: Retrieves earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API for seismic event analysis.
Disaster Alerts: Collects real-time disaster alerts via the ReliefWeb API.
Data Processing: Aggregates and processes the collected data using a Python script within a Kestra task.
Email Notifications: Sends automated disaster alerts to specified recipients for timely response.
Architecture
Workflow Orchestration:
Kestra orchestrates tasks defined declaratively in YAML, managing the dependencies between data collection, processing, and notification steps.

Data Collection:
APIs for weather, earthquakes, and disaster alerts provide raw data through individual Kestra tasks.

Data Processing:
A Python script, executed within a Kestra task, processes the collected data to generate actionable insights.

Notification System:
Kestra triggers an email task to send disaster alerts with critical event details.

Requirements
Kestra installation (self-hosted or Docker setup)
Python 3.x for data processing
An OpenWeatherMap API key
Access to the USGS Earthquake and ReliefWeb APIs (publicly accessible)
SMTP setup for email notifications
Installation
Install Kestra:
Follow the official Kestra installation guide.

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disaster-response-platform.git
cd disaster-response-platform
Deploy workflows:
Upload the Kestra workflow YAML file:

bash
Copy code
kestra upload disaster-platform.yaml
Configure Secrets:

Replace the placeholder in secrets.openweather_api_key with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
Set Variables:
Update parameters.city in the workflow to specify the target city for weather monitoring.

Usage
Start the Kestra server:

bash
Copy code
kestra start
Trigger the workflow:

bash
Copy code
kestra execute disaster.platform
Monitor execution:

View real-time execution logs in the Kestra UI.
Check email notifications for disaster alerts.

You're right! I overlooked mentioning Kestra, which is a key part of the project. Here's a revised version of the README with explicit references to Kestra, the workflow orchestration tool you're using:
